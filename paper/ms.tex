\begin{abstract}
% Context
The primary sample of the \gaia\ \textsl{First Data Release} is the brand-new
\textsl{Tycho-Gaia Astrometric Solution}. The precision and size of this sample
creates an opportunity to find new binary stars and moving groups, especially
rare binaries or sparsely populated groups.
% Aims
Here we seize this opportunity.
% Methods
We use a justified marginalized likelihood ratio test to separate
pairs of stars with surprisingly similar three-space velocities from
those consistent with being drawn independently from the field
population.  Although we perform some visualizations using a
(bias-corrected) inverse parallax as a distance, the likelihood test
works in the observable space and uses the \gaia\ noise model
responsibly.
% Results
We find pairs of comoving stars out to very wide
separations, including separations of a few parsecs! There does not
seem to be any tidal-disruption feature in the separation distribution
at sub-parsec scales. Pairs at separations beyond a
parsec---whether they are bound in a multiple system or drifting
apart---must be very short-lived. The photometric properties of the
members of these pairs are consistent with youth. The prospects for
testing stellar models and chemical abundance measurements are
superficially discussed.

\section{Introduction} \label{sec:intro}

Two stars moving with similar full-space velocity vectors (``co-moving stars'')
are either members of a widely-separated stellar multiplet, or remnants of a
dispersing stellar system.

Widely-separated binary stars are weakly bound binary star systems with
semi-major axes larger than $a \gtrsim 10^{-3}~{\rm pc}$. It is generally
assumed that the stars in a wide binary form from gas with the same chemical
composition and are separated enough that there is no interaction or minimal
cross-pollution as the more massive star evolves (\citealt{todo}). Because the
binding energy of these systems is so low, if wide binary stars survive for many
Gigayears their existence alone places limits on the tidal field of the Galaxy
(\citealt{todo}) and the graininess of the gravitational field (\citealt{todo}).
In this picture, a remaining puzzle is how these systems survive the dense
stellar environments of the birth clusters in which they form. Wide binaries are
therefore important tools for studying small-scale star formation and the
large-scale Galactic mass distribution. These stars will appear to be co-moving
with velocity differences comparable to the binary orbital velocity at the
given separation.

At the largest separations, $a \gtrsim 1~{\rm pc}$, co-moving stars are likely
either remnants of disrupting stellar systems or young wide binary stars: at
these extreme separations, the Galactic tidal field would disrupt binary stars
within $t_{\rm disrupt} \lesssim XX~{\rm Gyr}$. Unbound open clusters with
velocity dispersions $\sigma_v \lesssim 1~\kms$ in the Galactic disk disrupt
quickly leaving small streams of stars with the same chemical abundances
(\citealt{chemicaltaggingstuff}). Disrupting or disrupted globular clusters and
dwarf galaxies also produce streams of stars with similar chemical properties
but with larger velocity differences (\citealt{streampeeps}). Stars from such
systems at similar orbital phases will appear to be co-moving with velocity
differences comparable to the internal velocity dispersions, $\sigma_v \approx
1$--$10~\kms$.

To date, thousands of candidate co-moving star pairs have been identified by
searching for stars with common proper motions (\citealt{Luyten:1979,
Poveda:1994, Allen:2000, Gould:2003, Chaname:2004, Lepine:2007,
Alonso-Floriano:2015}). \todo{how is our search different? (1) we have distance, (2) bigger volume than Hipparcos, (3) we use the data properly, (4) we don't cut on distance or on magnitude of proper motion -- we cut on parallax S/N}

% Two stars moving with full-space velocity vector differences $\lesssim 1~\kms$
% with orbital semi-major axes $a \gtrsim 10^-3~{\rm pc}$.

Useful for:
- star cluster disruption and dispersal
- chemical abundance comparison (no interaction)
- dynamics

In either case, co-moving stars are of great interest
for studying the destruction of star clusters and dwarf galaxies, the tidal
field and small-scale properties of the mass distribution in the Milky Way, and
chemical uniformity and star formation processes.

\section{Data} \label{sec:data}

The primary data set used in this \documentname\ is the Tycho-Gaia Astrometric
Solution (\tgas), released as a part of Data Release 1 (\dr) of the Gaia mission
(\citealt{many}). \tgas\ contains astrometric measurements (sky position,
parallax, and proper motions) and associated covariance matrices for a large
fraction of the \project{Tycho-2} catalog (\citealt{tycho2}) with median
astrometric precision comparable to that of the \project{Hipparcos} catalog
($\approx 0.3~{\rm mas}$; \citealt{hipparcos}). In terms of parallax
signal-to-noise ($\snr = \varpi/\sigma_\varpi$), the \tgas\ catalog contains
42385 high-precision stars with $\snr > 32$: here we visualize quantities
computed from this high-precsision sample to emphasize the quality of the data.
In the sections that follow, we construct a statistical model that propagates
the non-trivial uncertainties in the data to our beliefs about the likelihood
that a given pair are co-moving.

For each star with $\snr > 32$, we use the reported parallax and parallax
error to compute a distance corrected for the Lutz-Kelker bias
(\citealt{lutzkelker}):
\begin{equation}
  d_{\rm LK} = 1000 \, \left[\frac{\varpi}{2} \,
    \left(1 + \sqrt{1 - \frac{16}{\snr^2}} \right) \right]^{-1} \, {\rm pc}
\end{equation}
We use this distance and the sky positions of each source to compute 3D
Cartesian positions, $\boldsymbol{x}$, for all stars and find the nearest
neighbor to each source in 3-space using the KDTree implementation in
\project{scikit-learn} (\citealt{scikit-learn}). We remove duplicates from
this sample and are left with 29870 pairs of stars. For all pairs, we then
compute the tangential velocity difference
\begin{equation}
  |\Delta \bs{v}_{\rm t}| = d_{\rm LK} \,
                            \sqrt{(\mu_{\alpha,1}-\mu_{\alpha,2})^2 +
                                  (\mu_{\delta,1}-\mu_{\delta,2})^2}
\end{equation}
\figname~\ref{fig:dv-sep} shows the tangential velocity difference against the
physical separation plotted for all pairs that pass the above signal-to-noise
cut. Pairs with small physical separation also tend to have small velocity
differences. Intriguingly, there appear to be an abundance of pairs with small
velocity separation at separations $|\delta\bs{x}| \gtrsim 1~{\rm pc}$.

\end{center}
\caption{%

widely-separated binary stars.

\end{figure*}

\todo{More naive visualizations, or save for the full sample?}

\section{Methods} \label{sec:methods}

The abundance of pairs of stars with small velocity difference in the
high-precsision sample of \figname~\ref{fig:dv-sep} suggests that there are a
significant number of co-moving stars in the \tgas\ data at separations as large
as a few parsecs. Here we develop a method to select high-confidence co-moving
stars that properly incorporates the complex uncertainties associated with the
\gaia\ data. We make the following assumptions in order to construct a
statistical model (a likelihood function with explicit priors on our
parameters):
\begin{itemize}
  \item We assume that the uncertainties in the data---parallax, $\varpi$, and
    two proper motion components, $\propm = (\begin{array}[t]{c c} \mu_\alpha &
    \mu_\delta\end{array})^\mathsf{T}$---are Gaussian with known covariances
    $\matrx{C}$.
  \item We assume that the 3-space velocities of a given pair of stars
    $(\bs{v}_i, \bs{v}_j)$ in the \tgas\ sample (relative to the solar system
    barycenter) are either (1) co-moving with velocity drawn from a velocity
    prior $p(\bs{v})$ and  velocity difference drawn from a zero-mean Gaussian
    with velocity dispersion $s$, or (2) individually drawn from a velocity
    prior $p(\bs{v})$.
\end{itemize}

Under these assumptions, the likelihood of a proper motion measurement for a
star given true distance, $d$, and true tangential velocity, $\bs{v}^\perp =
(\begin{array}[t]{c c} v_\alpha & v_\delta\end{array})^\mathsf{T}$ is
\begin{align}
  L(\bs{v}, d, s^2) &=
    \left[\det\left(\frac{\tilde{\matrx{C}}^{-1}}{2\pi}\right)\right]^{1/2} \,
    \exp \left[ -\frac{1}{2} \transp{\left(\bs{\mu} - \bs{x}_\theta \right)} \,
    \tilde{\matrx{C}}^{-1} \,
    \left(\bs{\mu} - \bs{x}_\theta \right) \right] \\
  \bs{x}_\theta &= d^{-1} \, \bs{v}^\perp
\end{align}
where the tangential velocity $\bs{v}^\perp$ is related to the 3-space velocity
$\bs{v}$ through projection onto a tangent plane at a given star's sky position
$(\alpha, \delta)$
\begin{align}
  \bs{v}^\perp &= \matrx{M}\,\bs{v} \\
  & = \left(
      \begin{array}{c c c}
        -\sin\alpha & \cos\alpha & 0 \\
        -\sin\delta \, \cos\alpha & -\sin\delta \, \sin\alpha & \cos\delta
      \end{array}
    \right) \,
    \left(\begin{array}{c} v_x \\ v_y \\ v_z \end{array}\right)
\end{align}
and the modified covariance matrix $\tilde{\matrx{C}}$ is
\begin{equation}
  \tilde{\matrx{C}} = \matrx{C} + \eye\,s^2
\end{equation}

We compute the fully marginalized likelihood (FML) that a given pair of stars
has the same 3-space velocity with a small velocity difference drawn from a
zero-mean Gaussian with variance $s^2$ (hypothesis 1, $\mathcal{L}_1$), and
the FML of the stars having different 3-space velocities (hypothesis 2,
$\mathcal{L}_2$).
We use the FML ratio $\mathcal{L}_1/\mathcal{L}_2$ as a scalar for selecting
candidate co-moving stars, as described below in more detail.
To compute these FMLs, the likelihood functions $L_i, L_j$ are marginalized
over true 3-space velocity and distance for each star in the pair $(i,j)$.
\begin{align}
  \mathcal{L}_1 &=
    \int \, \dd d_i \, \dd d_j \, \dd^3 \bs{v} \,
    L_i(\bs{v}, d_i, s^2) \,
    L_j(\bs{v}, d_j, s^2) \,
    p(\bs{v}) \, p(d_i \given \varpi_i) \, p(d_j \given \varpi_j) \\
  \mathcal{L}_2 &=
    \int \, \dd d_i \, \dd d_j \, \dd^3 \bs{v}_i \, \dd^3 \bs{v}_j \,
    L_i(\bs{v}_i, d_i, 0) \,
    L_j(\bs{v}_j, d_j, 0) \,
    p(\bs{v}_i) \, p(\bs{v}_j) \, p(d_i \given \varpi_i) \, p(d_j \given \varpi_j). \label{eq:hyp2}
\end{align}
The marginalization integral for hypothesis 2 can be split into the product of
two simpler integrals $\mathcal{L}_2 = Q_i \, Q_j$ where
\begin{equation}
  Q = \int \, \dd d \, \dd^3 \bs{v} \, L(\bs{v}, d, 0) \, p(\bs{v}) \, p(d\given\varpi)
\end{equation}
If the velocity prior $p(\bs{v})$ is also Gaussian, the integrals over velocity
in both cases can be performed analytically:
\todo{SMOH: is this what we do?}
We use an equal-weight mixture of three isotropic, zero-mean Gaussian
distributions
\begin{equation}
  p(\bs{v}) = \frac{1}{3} \, \sum_{m=1}^3 \, \mathcal{N}(0, \sigma_m^2)
\end{equation}
with velocity dispersions $(\sigma_1, \sigma_2, \sigma_3) = (8, 32, 128)~\kms$
meant to represent young disk stars, old disk stars, and halo stars.
We derive the relevant expressions in Appendix~\ref{sec:appendix}.
After marginalizing over velocity, the likelihood integrands only depend on
distance; we numerically compute the integrals over the true distances to each
star in a pair, $d_1,d_2$, using Monte Carlo integration with $K$ samples from
the distance posterior pdfs:
\begin{equation}
  \int \, \dd d \, \tilde{L}(d) \, p(d\given\varpi) \approx
    \frac{1}{K} \, \sum_k^K \, \tilde{L}(d_k)
\end{equation}
where $\tilde{L}(d)$ is the velocity-marginalized likelihood function.
Through experimentation, we have found that $K=128$ samples are sufficient for
estimating the above integrals for stars with a wide range in parallax
signal-to-noise.

\section{Some mathematics relevant to the above} \label{sec:appendix}

\todo{APW will clean this up}

In what follows, all vectors are column vectors, unless we have transposed them.
We indicate whether a symbol represents a scalar, vector, or tensor
(matrix) by context, not typesetting.
Properties of the squared exponential:
\begin{eqnarray}
  \ln\left[\int\exp(-\frac{1}{2}\,\transp{[x-\nu]}\,\inv{A}\,[x-\nu] - \Delta)\,\dd x\right]
  &=& +\frac{1}{2}\ln ||2\pi\,A|| -\Delta
  \quad ,
\end{eqnarray}
where $x$ and $\nu$ are $D$-dimensional vectors, $A$ is a positive definite
matrix, $\Delta$ is a scalar, and the integral is implicitly over all
of $D$-dimensional $x$-space.
We will need to complete squares.
If we equate
\begin{eqnarray}
  \frac{1}{2}\,\transp{[x-\nu]}\,\inv{A}\,[x-\nu] + \Delta
  &=& \frac{1}{2}\,\transp{x}\,\inv{A}\,x + \transp{x}\,B\,b + C
  \quad ,
\end{eqnarray}
where $B\,b$ is a $d$-vector, and $C$ is a scalar, then we find
\begin{eqnarray}
  \nu &=& -A\,B\,b
  \\
  \Delta & = & C - \frac{1}{2}\,\transp{\nu}\,\inv{A}\,\nu
  \quad .
\end{eqnarray}

Now in this case, we want to write down the probability density for the data
given the distances and velocity (the likelihood), and the prior pdf for
the velocity, and their product.
The prior pdf for the velocity is Gaussian:
\begin{eqnarray}
  p(v) &=& \normal(v\given 0,V)
  \\
  \ln p(v) &=& -\frac{1}{2}\,\ln||2\pi\,V|| -\frac{1}{2}\,\transp{v}\,\inv{V}\,v
  \\
  V &=& \sigma_v^2\,I
  \quad ,
\end{eqnarray}
where $v$ is the three-vector velocity, and $V$ is an isotropic
variance tensor.
Similarly, the likelihood for the data is also a Gaussian.
Before we write that down, we will make some definitions.
We construct a velocity-space data vector $y$ as follows:
\begin{eqnarray}
  \transp{y} &\equiv& [(d_1\,\mu_{\alpha1}), (d_1\,\mu_{\delta1}),
                       (d_2\,\mu_{\alpha2}), (d_2\,\mu_{\delta2})] \quad \mbox{or}
  \\
  \transp{y} &\equiv& [(d_1\,\mu_{\alpha1}), (d_1\,\mu_{\delta1}), (v_{r1}),
                       (d_2\,\mu_{\alpha2}), (d_2\,\mu_{\delta2}), (v_{r2})]
  \quad ,
\end{eqnarray}
where we have given two versions, a 4-component and an 6-component
version (depending on whether there are measured radial velocities),
the subscripts 1, 2 refer to the first and second stars (arbitrarily
ordered) of the pair, we have multiplied the strict observables by
distances $d_1, d_2$, which we are permitted to do (because we are
\emph{conditioning} on $d_1, d_2$), and note the wacky minus-ones.
The vector $y$ is a column vector that we have transposed to make it
easy to write down.
Fundamentally, our H1 model (same velocity) is
\begin{eqnarray}
  y &=& M\,v + \mathrm{noise}
  \\
  \transp{M} &=& [\hat{\alpha_1}, \hat{\delta_1},
                  \hat{\alpha_2}, \hat{\delta_2}] \quad \mbox{or}
  \\
  \transp{M} &=& [\hat{\alpha}_1, \hat{\delta}_2, \hat{r}_1,
                  \hat{\alpha}_2, \hat{\delta}_2, \hat{r}_2]
  \quad,
\end{eqnarray}
where $M$ is a $6\times 3$ or $8\times 3$ design matrix, with zeros
in two rows, and unit vectors along the other rows.
The noise (in the $y$ vector) is drawn from a Gaussian with ($6\times 6$ or $8\times 8$)
covariance matrix $\Sigma$, constructed from the distances $d_1, d_2$ and
the \gaia-provided individual-object covariance matrices.
Given all these definitions, the likelihood function is
\begin{eqnarray}
  p(\data\given v,d_1,d_2) &=& d_1^2\,d_2^2\,\normal(y\given M\,v, \Sigma)
  \\
  \ln p(\data\given v,d_1,d_2) &=& 3\,\ln d_1 + 3\,\ln d_2
  -\frac{1}{2}\,\ln||2\pi\,\Sigma|| \nonumber \\ && \quad
  -\frac{1}{2}\,\transp{[y-M\,v]}\,\inv{\Sigma}\,[y-M\,v]
  \quad ,
\end{eqnarray}
where the factor of $d_1^2\,d_2^2$ converts to units of per \gaia\ data
from units of per $y$.

Now we multiply together (add in the log) and complete the square.
We get, in the original parameterization:
\begin{eqnarray}
  \inv{A} &=& [\transp{M}\,\inv{\Sigma}\,M+\inv{V}]
  \\
  \nu &=& -A\,\transp{M}\,\inv{\Sigma}\,y
  \\
  \Delta &=& -2\,\ln d_1 -2\,\ln d_2
  +\frac{1}{2}\,\ln||2\pi\,\Sigma|| +\frac{1}{2}\,\ln||2\pi\,V|| \nonumber \\ && \quad
  +\frac{1}{2}\,\transp{y}\,\inv{\Sigma}\,y -\frac{1}{2}\,\transp{\nu}\,\inv{A}\,\nu
  \quad ,
\end{eqnarray}
where there are sign issues that Hogg doesn't like to think about.
Finally, we marginalize out the velocity to get the marginalized
likelihood conditioned on the two distances $d_1, d_2$:
\begin{eqnarray}
  \ln p(\data\given d_1,d_2)
  &=& \frac{1}{2}\ln ||2\pi\,A|| -\Delta
  \quad .
\end{eqnarray}

The story for the H2 model (independent velocities) is very
similar. In this case, the marginalized likelihood is a product of
two independent integrals $Q$ each constructed as follows:
\begin{eqnarray}
  \transp{y} &\equiv& [(d\,\mu_{\alpha}), (d\,\mu_{\delta})] \quad \mbox{or}
  \\
  \transp{y} &\equiv& [(d\,\mu_{\alpha}), (d\,\mu_{\delta}), (v_{r})]
  \\
  \transp{M} &=& [\hat{\alpha}, \hat{\delta}] \quad \mbox{or}
  \\
  \transp{M} &=& [\hat{\alpha}, \hat{\delta}_2, \hat{r}]
  \\
  \inv{A} &=& [\transp{M}\,\inv{\Sigma}\,M+\inv{V}]
  \\
  \nu &=& A\,\transp{M}\,\inv{\Sigma}\,y
  \\
  \Delta &=& -2\,\ln d
  +\frac{1}{2}\,\ln||2\pi\,\Sigma|| +\frac{1}{2}\,\ln||2\pi\,V|| \nonumber \\ && \quad
  +\frac{1}{2}\,\transp{y}\,\inv{\Sigma}\,y -\frac{1}{2}\,\transp{\nu}\,\inv{A}\,\nu
  \\
  Q &=& \frac{1}{2}\ln ||2\pi\,A|| -\Delta
  \quad ,
\end{eqnarray}
where again there are two options for the dimensionality of $y$ and
$M$, and once the vectors and $\Sigma$ are properly truncated to one
star, everything else follows.
